is a name or identifier
constant values cnanot change during execution
is a case sensitive and always in uppercase
names start with letter or underscore follwoed by any number, letter or underscore
if you defined a constant, you cnnot be changed.
donot need to have a constant with dollor sign($).
two ways:
define() function:
	to use define() for define a constant.
 	define('name','value')

	check the constant value is defined or not and display in boolen value like 0 or 1
	echo defined("NAME");

	display the constant value
	echo NAME;

const keyword:
	define constant using const keyword
	const age=23;

	display the constant value
	echo age;


Use already defined varibale values as a constant:
	$id=2030;
    	define("ID".$id,$id);
    	echo "ID";

Magical Constant
	PHP provides a large number of predefined constants to any script which it runs.

	__LINE__        -  current line number of the file
	__FILE__         - full path of the file
	__FUNCTION__    - function name
	__CLASS__      - class
	__METHOD__     -method
   
	

difference between constant and variable
 In constant, no need to put dollar sign  whereas variable need dollar sign.
 constant must be assigned using define() function
 it can be accessed anywhere without variable scopes rules
 once constant is set, it cannot be redefined or undefined.
