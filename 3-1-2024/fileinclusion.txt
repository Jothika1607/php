File inclusion - two ways

include() function
	takes all the text in a specified file and copies it into the file that used the include function
	if there is any problem in loading a file then include() func generates a warning but the script will continue execution

The require() function 
	takes all the text in a specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include function. 
	If there is any problem in loading a file then the require() function generates a fatal error and halt the execution of the script.


Difference between them
	there is no difference in require() and include() except they handle error conditions. 
	It is recommended to use the require() function instead of include()
	because scripts should not continue executing if files are missing or misnamed.
